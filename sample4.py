# Number Guessing Feedback
# Story:
# A guessing game checks if the player's number is too high, too low, or correct.
# Task:
# Set a secret number (e.g. 7). Ask the user to guess. Print feedback:
# "Too low"
# "Too high"
# "Correct!"

# secret_number = 7
# guess_number = int(input("Guess a number: "))

# if guess_number < secret_number:
#     print("Too low")
# elif guess_number > secret_number:
#     print("Too high")
# else:
#     print("Correct!")
